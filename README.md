# Campfire
A web framework for the Mojo programming language ðŸ”¥

## Installation and Usage
- There's no package manager yet??
- This is totally not production ready - let alone even ready to be used in a project
- I totally don't recommend using this yet!

## Deployment
- I wasted about 5 hours today trying to get this to deploy on Render in a Docker container
- I'm going to try again tomorrow, it's 50% a skill issue and 50% a software issue
